# Introduction

The CSV file contains data related to e-commerce sales, comprising 9,994 rows and 22 columns. Each row represents an order with details such as:

- **Order Information**: `Row ID`, `Order ID`, `Year`, `Order Date`, `Ship Date`, `Ship Mode`.
- **Customer Details**: `Customer ID`, `Customer Name`, `Segment`.
- **Location Details**: `Country`, `City`, `State`, `Postal Code`, `Region`.
- **Product Information**: `Product ID`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Product Name`.

This dataset provides an overview of orders, shipping details, customer segments, product categories, and financial metrics, which can be useful for analyzing sales performance, customer trends, and profitability.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. How much sales are made by city?

![salesByCity](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffe26e29-8e63-479b-8023-f3485fba29d4)

2. How much sales are made by state?
   
![SalesByState](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e62c476a-3fca-4e55-a6ea-a6e89d0af27c)
California made the highest sales among all the states, while North Dakota made the least sales.

3. How much sales are made by region?
   
![SalesByRegion](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7991d625-3e9f-4836-a64d-9ee379b85e08)
The West region has the highest sales, followed by the East, Central, and South regions.

4. What percentage are made by each region?
   
![SalesPercentageByRegion](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d18864a9-6ff1-4ebb-8666-261397908559)
The West region accounts for 31.6% of total sales. The East region is second with 29.5%, followed by the Central region with 21.8%, and the South region with 17.1%.

5. List the top ten product with the highest sales?

   |Product Name|Month Name|Sales|

Let's plot the distribution curve of Yeo-Johnson transformed data

Let's see the scatter plot for the transformed discount sales
![discountSalesYeoJohnson](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7ef769f-1e3f-404f-8569-1fafce598eda)

- After transforming the data, we can see that there is no relationship between sales and discount.
- Discount does not cause increase in sales.
- Higher discount does not result in higher sales.
  ### Recommendation
- To keep the profit margins high and ensure a healthy bottom line, the discount rate should be reduced to a minimum.

8. Does Sales differs significantly across region?
   
|ANOVA Result|
|------------|
|F-statistic: 0.8006|
|p-value: 0.4933|
Sales does not differs significantly across region. 

9. Which category made the highest sales?
    
![SalesByCategory](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48e0cafd-7e89-4765-8c35-7a74bebc28d7)
Technology has the highest sales, followed by furniture and office supplies. The difference between the highest and lowest sales categories exceeds 10%.

10. Does sales varies significantly across category?

|Category ANOVA Result:|
|----------------------|
|F-statistic: 265.4898|
|p-value: 0.0000|
Sales varies significantly across categories.

 The significant result implies that product categories play a critical role in determining sales patterns. Businesses can leverage this insight by:

- Customizing marketing strategies for each category to capitalize on its strengths.
- Optimizing discount levels to maximize sales without compromising profits in high- or low-value categories.
- Segmenting customers further within each category to better understand their purchasing behaviors.
